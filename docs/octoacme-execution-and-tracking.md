# OctoAcme — Execution & Tracking

## Purpose
Guidance for managing day-to-day execution and tracking progress toward project milestones.

## Team Rhythm
- Daily standups (15 min) — focus on progress, blockers, dependencies
- Weekly delivery sync — show progress, updates, and flagged risks
- Demo/Review at the end of each sprint or milestone

## Workflows
- Use the project board (e.g., GitHub Projects) with columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done
- Pull Request workflow:
  - Small PRs (<= 400 lines when possible)
  - Include issue link and acceptance criteria in PR description
  - Run automated tests and linting in CI before requesting review
  - Require at least one approval before merging (or team-defined policy)
  - Security Lead reviews PRs with security implications
  - UX Designer reviews PRs with UI/UX changes for design fidelity
- Documentation workflow:
  - Technical Writer reviews feature documentation and user-facing content
  - Update relevant docs and help content as part of feature delivery

## Quality & Testing
- Unit tests for new logic
- Integration tests where applicable
- End-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release
- Security scanning in CI (monitored by Security Lead)
- Usability testing with UX Designer for major UI changes
- Manual QA for feature acceptance when needed
- Documentation review by Technical Writer for accuracy and completeness

## Reporting & Metrics
- Track velocity and burndown
- Monitor success metrics identified in the Project One-pager
- Use dashboards for key signals (errors, latency, usage)

## Blocker Escalation
- **Level 1**: Team-level triage in daily standup
- **Level 2**: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- **Level 3**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues
- **Security escalation**: Security Lead coordinates security-related issues with appropriate stakeholders and follows security incident procedures

## Execution Checklist
