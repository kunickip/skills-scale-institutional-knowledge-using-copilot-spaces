# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This repository centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes, roles, and best practices. Below, find a brief overview of our program execution workflow and links to our living documentation.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme leverages a structured, iterative lifecycle that starts with project initiation and planning before moving into daily execution, release, and continuous improvement. Each initiative begins with clear goals, stakeholder alignment, timeline, and a project charter. Planning breaks work into shippable increments, prioritizes backlog items, and identifies risks and dependencies to ensure successful delivery.

Key roles include Project Managers (PMs), Product Managers (PdMs), Developers, QA specialists, and direct stakeholders. PMs coordinate schedules and communication, Product Managers set priorities and outcomes, and delivery team members focus on implementation and validation. Collaboration is fostered through regular standups, syncs, demos, and feedback loops, while communication with stakeholders is maintained via updates, escalation paths, and documentation.

Workflow centers on visual project boards, disciplined pull request and QA practices, and risk/issue tracking. Quality assurance involves unit, integration, and end-to-end testing coupled with automated CI and manual QA where needed. Releases follow standardized checklists and rollback plans, improving predictability and stakeholder confidence. Retrospectives ensure ongoing learning and continuous process improvement.

This programmatic approach provides a repeatable, transparent, and adaptable framework for executing high-impact projects at OctoAcme, empowering teams to deliver reliably and sustainably.
